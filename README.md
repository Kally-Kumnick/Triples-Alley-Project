# The Triples Alley Challenge is a collaborative effort between three popular San Francisco races to motivate runners to participate in all events. 
# The races include: Bay To Breakers, The SF Giants Race, Diplo Run Club. 
# The primary goal of this project was to clean and standardize participant data from each race, identify repeat participants, and create targeted marketing strategies to boost participation across all events.
